2D Top Down pixel art game

In this project i tried to complete the 2 questions out of three which are
  1. Create a dialogue system for the game that allows the player character to interact with AI
      characters through conversations. The dialogue system should have branching paths based on
      the player's choices and should affect the game's storyline.
  3. Implement a death-handling system for the game that allows AI characters to die and respawn if
      necessary. The death handling system should be able to handle different types of deaths, such
      as natural causes or violent attacks.

It was little challenging for me but on progressing on this project I was able to learn much more from unity and its features

For this project I used my own assets like the tileset for tilemap and the player character with animations. The only assets which are fences, NPC character and Enemy slime are downloaded assets.

I was not able to fully complete the given task but gave a try on the approach

During working on dialogue system I came across that the packages which are meant for dialogue brancing are paid on the asset store like 'Conversa' or 'Dialogue system', due to which I was not able to create options like choises in dialogue system


--- Working of project: ---

- To move the player use 'WASD' or 'arrow keys' on the keyboard
- Left click on Mouse triggers the attack animation on player character
- Attack animation affects on the direction the character is moving

- Attacking on Enemy slime will defeat the enemy and will respawn after certain time interval
- After approaching the NPC character pressing 'E' on keyboard will initiate the dialogue system between player and NPC
